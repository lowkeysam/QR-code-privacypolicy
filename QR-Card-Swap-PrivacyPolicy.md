# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 21/11/24

**QR Card Swap** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is handled when you use our app, QR Card Swap ("the App"). 

We believe in keeping things simple: **we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data**. Everything is stored securely on your device, under your control.

## Information We Collect

We collect **no personal data**.  
All contact details and QR codes you create or use within the App are stored **locally on your phone** and never sent to our servers or third parties.

---

## How Your Data Is Used

Since all data remains on your device:
- We don’t access, process, or use your data for any purpose.
- Sharing your QR code is entirely up to you, and the data is shared directly between you and the recipient.

---

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any of your information to anyone. Any sharing of your QR code or contact information is initiated and controlled by you.

---

## Data Security

Your data’s security is our priority:
- All information is stored locally on your device.
- The App does not upload or sync your data with external servers or cloud services.

However, we recommend taking your own measures to protect your device from unauthorized access.

---

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store any data, there’s nothing to access, delete, or transfer. Your data stays entirely in your hands.

---

## Third-Party Services

QR Card Swap does not use any third-party services that collect or process your data. There are no analytics, ads, or external integrations in the App.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available within the App or at [https://github.com/lowkeysam/QR-code-privacypolicy.md](https://github.com/lowkeysam/QR-code-privacypolicy/blob/main/QR-Card-Swap-PrivacyPolicy.md).
